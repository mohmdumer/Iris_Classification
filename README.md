## Iris_Classification
# Overview
This project involves performing multiclass classification on the Iris dataset using logistic regression. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, often used for benchmarking classification algorithms. In this project, we achieved an accuracy of 97%.

# Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample has four features:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
# Objective
The objective of this project is to classify the Iris flowers into one of the three species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica) using the given features.

# Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Loaded the dataset and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and target classes.
Model Selection: Chose logistic regression for its simplicity and effectiveness in multiclass classification problems.
# Training the Model: Split the dataset into training and testing sets and trained the logistic regression model on the training data.
# Evaluation: Evaluated the model using accuracy as the performance metric.
# Results
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying the Iris dataset.
